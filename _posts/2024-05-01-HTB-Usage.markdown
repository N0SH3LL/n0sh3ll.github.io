Usage starts with a web application vulnerable to SQL injection. After a thorough enumeration, I'll use sqlmap to get a database dump with some hashes. After cracking the hash of an web admin account, I'll use CVE-xxxx-xxxx to exploit a file upload vulnerability to get a reverse shell as www. For lateral movement, I'll explore some hidden files to find a user password. I'll then use a wildcard trick to leverage a custom binary to dump a root ssh key.
