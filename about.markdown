Welcome to yet another cyber blog! With only a short time in infosec, I'm using this page to aid my own education and document projects and CTF challenges I take on along the way. 

You'll get what you pay for here -- I don't pretend to be an expert, and I welcome any challenges to my methods. My primary goal is to deepen my understanding of information security concepts and practices, and to connect with like-minded professionals and enthusiasts also on the path. I welcome any and all critiques, connections, and communications.

Join me as I document my confusion and stumble towards knowledge, one challenge at a time!
